# Patent2ProductRAG
This repository entails the Patent to Product process using an Agentic RAG approach

The Ingestion and QA phase are separate.

Run Ingestion first (either in firm_summary_rag.py or InternshipRAG_pipeline.py) and then run the Streamlit App for QA

Note: The summaries generated by Qwen seems to be more effective than the summaries by GPT.
