# Patent2ProductRAG
This repository entails the Patent to Product process using an Agentic RAG approach

### Notes 
The Ingestion and QA phase are separate.

Run Ingestion first (either in firm_summary_rag.py or InternshipRAG_pipeline.py) and then run the Streamlit App for QA.

**Note:** The summaries generated by Qwen seems to be more effective than the summaries by GPT.

### Authors
This project is a simplified version of the InnovaRAG repository, and was done in collaboration with **[Nguyen Quang Phu (pdz1804)](https://github.com/pdz1804)**
